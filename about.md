My past experiences have included stints doing technical support for a [BI software company](https://www.informationbuilders.com) where I focused on backend support related to ETL processes, performance and connectivity issues to databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle and others that offered JDBC/ODBC-based drivers as well as RESTful APIs. I also founded and sold a LAMP-based [photo sharing app](https://www.trekearth.com). Recently I completed a data science program where I wrangled data most days and used Python-based machine learning tools as well as statistical knowledge to develop regression and classification models published as Flask apps.

This blog is where I write about things I encounter related to data science and web development including Python and cloud platforms such as AWS. Check out my [projects](/projects/) and [email me](mailto:asilverman.sf@gmail.com) with any questions and feedback.
